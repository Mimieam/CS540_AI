An Introduction to Artificial intelligence and it's challenge using the Animal Checker Game.

Abstract
Introduction

The field of artificial intelligence

talk about the issues that we are trying to solve
  - search and representation
  - board game represented at a 2D array
  - illustrate with Animal chercker game


The game
 2 player game where each opponent start with  ( one of which being the AI) are competing to reach their opponent den.
 - description of the game with picture




Design CHOICES AND FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM
  language - and why ?
  python - for rapid prototyping.
  personal syntax preference ( function closure enforced by indentation and free of curly brackets)

  short definition and how it is used:
  - small opening book use for the first 5 to 10 ply
  - heuristic search algorithm
  -
  - SEF:
      - distance from den
      -
  - Transposition table
  - help menu
  - tracking all game move
  - alpha beta minimax for the search

using the program
  - actual game run

THE PROGRAM'S PERFORMANCE
  - depth


Conclusion
  is it intelligent ?
  issues
  room for improvement ?
